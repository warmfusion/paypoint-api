		PayPoint.net's PayCash is a secure, real-time, online cash payment service that allows you to accept payment for
		online transactions in cash.

		The services generates a barcode that is available to the customer online during the checkout process or sent to
		them via an email or SMS by you.
		The barcode can be scanned from a print out or a mobile device in any of PayPointâ€™s 25,000 outlets thus
		completing the payment.
		You will then receive instant payment confirmation for onward fulfilment, acknowledgement or reconciliation.
