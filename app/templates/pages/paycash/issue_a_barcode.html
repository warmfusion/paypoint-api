<div class="page-body">
	<p>
		The first step to processing a PayCash transaction is to submit a PayCash Issue request via our API. As part of
		the request you will need
		to send details of your customer. This can include name, address, email address etc but at a minimum just needs
		you to provide a unique reference.
    </p>

    <p>
		The PayCash issue request should also include the URL you want us to send notification of the completed cash
		payment.
	</p>

	<p>
		Weâ€™ll respond to your PayCash issue request with a URL for the barcode. You can use this to present to the
		customer on-screen, via email or SMS.

		with a PayCash issue. Please refer to the relevant section.
